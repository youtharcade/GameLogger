# GameLoggr iCloud Setup & TestFlight Preparation Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the complete process of enabling iCloud synchronization for your GameLoggr app and preparing it for TestFlight distribution. The code changes have already been implemented, but you'll need to complete several configuration steps in Xcode and Apple Developer Console.

## Part 1: iCloud Setup

### Code Changes Already Completed ✅

The following files have been updated to support CloudKit:

1. **GameLogger.entitlements**: Added CloudKit and iCloud capabilities
2. **GameLoggerApp.swift**: Updated SwiftData configuration to use CloudKit
3. **Schema**: Added missing models (Hardware, HelpfulLink) to the schema

### Required Xcode Configuration Steps

#### Step 1: Enable iCloud Capability
1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Select your **GameLoggr** target
3. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. Click **+ Capability** 
5. Add **iCloud**
6. Under iCloud services, check:
   - ☑️ **CloudKit**
   - ☑️ **Key-value storage**

#### Step 2: Configure CloudKit Container
1. In the iCloud capability section, you should see:
   - Container: `iCloud.com.justingain.GameLoggr`
2. If the container doesn't exist, Xcode will create it automatically
3. Ensure the container identifier matches what's in your entitlements file

#### Step 3: Verify Bundle Identifier
Ensure your bundle identifier is set to: `com.justingain.GameLoggr`

### Apple Developer Console Configuration

#### Step 1: App Identifier Setup
1. Go to [Apple Developer Console](https://developer.apple.com)
2. Navigate to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**
3. Select **Identifiers** → **App IDs**
4. Find your `com.justingain.GameLoggr` identifier
5. Click **Edit** and ensure these capabilities are enabled:
   - ☑️ **iCloud**
   - ☑️ **Push Notifications** (automatically enabled with CloudKit)

#### Step 2: CloudKit Container Configuration
1. In Developer Console, go to **CloudKit Console**
2. Select your `iCloud.com.justingain.GameLoggr` container
3. The schema will be automatically created when you first run the app
4. You can view and manage your CloudKit schema here after initial setup

## Part 2: TestFlight Preparation

### App Store Connect Setup

#### Step 1: Create App Record
1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Click **My Apps** → **+** → **New App**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Platform**: iOS
   - **Name**: GameLoggr
   - **Primary Language**: English
   - **Bundle ID**: com.justingain.GameLoggr
   - **SKU**: (use something like: gameloggr-ios-2025)

#### Step 2: App Information
Complete these required sections:
- **App Information**: Name, subtitle, category (Utilities or Entertainment)
- **Pricing and Availability**: Free or paid
- **App Privacy**: See privacy section below

### Build Configuration

#### Step 1: Version and Build Numbers
Update your project settings:
- **Version**: 1.0.0 (for first release)
- **Build**: 1 (increment for each TestFlight build)

#### Step 2: Archive Settings
Before archiving for TestFlight:
1. Select **Any iOS Device (arm64)** as the destination
2. Go to **Product** → **Archive**
3. In Organizer, select your archive and click **Distribute App**
4. Choose **App Store Connect**
5. Upload to TestFlight

### App Privacy Configuration

Since your app now syncs with iCloud, you need to declare data practices:

#### Required Privacy Declarations
In App Store Connect, under **App Privacy**, declare:

**Data Types Collected:**
- **Gaming** → Game Data
  - Used for: App functionality, Analytics (optional)
  - Collected: Yes
  - Linked to user: Yes (through iCloud account)
  - Used for tracking: No

**Third-Party Data:**
- If using IGDB API for game data:
  - Declare external data sources
  - No personal data shared with third parties

#### Privacy Policy Considerations
You may need a privacy policy if:
- You collect any personal information
- You use analytics services
- You plan to monetize the app

Sample privacy statement:
> "GameLoggr stores your game collection data in your personal iCloud account. No personal information is shared with third parties. Game metadata is retrieved from public databases (IGDB) for informational purposes only."

### Testing Guidelines

#### Internal Testing
1. Add internal testers (your Apple ID) in TestFlight
2. Test core functionality:
   - ☑️ App launches successfully
   - ☑️ Data syncs across devices (test with two devices)
   - ☑️ iCloud sync works when switching between devices
   - ☑️ Offline functionality works
   - ☑️ Data persists after app deletion/reinstall

#### Critical Test Scenarios
- **First Launch**: App creates CloudKit schema correctly
- **Data Migration**: Existing local data migrates to CloudKit
- **Sync Conflicts**: Test simultaneous edits on multiple devices
- **Network Issues**: App handles poor connectivity gracefully
- **Sign Out/In**: iCloud account changes work correctly

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### CloudKit Schema Errors
**Problem**: "CloudKit schema mismatch" errors
**Solution**: 
- Delete the app from all test devices
- In CloudKit Console, reset the Development schema
- Rebuild and test again

#### Sync Not Working
**Problem**: Data not syncing between devices
**Solution**:
- Verify both devices are signed into the same iCloud account
- Check that iCloud Drive is enabled in device settings
- Ensure network connectivity
- Check CloudKit Console for sync errors

#### TestFlight Upload Failures
**Problem**: Archive fails or upload rejected
**Solution**:
- Ensure all capabilities are properly configured
- Check for missing provisioning profiles
- Verify app identifier matches exactly
- Update Xcode to latest version

### Launch Checklist

Before submitting to App Review:

#### Technical Requirements
- ☑️ App builds and runs on iOS 17.0+
- ☑️ CloudKit sync works reliably
- ☑️ No crashes during normal usage
- ☑️ App handles network failures gracefully
- ☑️ Memory usage is reasonable
- ☑️ Battery usage is acceptable

#### App Store Requirements

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Xcode Configuration**: Follow the steps above to enable iCloud capability
2. **Test Locally**: Build and run the app to verify CloudKit integration works
3. **Upload to TestFlight**: Create your first archive and upload
4. **Internal Testing**: Test sync functionality across multiple devices
5. **App Store Submission**: Once testing is complete, submit for review
