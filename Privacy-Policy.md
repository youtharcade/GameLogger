**Effective Date**: December 18, 2024  
**Last Updated**: December 18, 2024

## Introduction

GameLoggr ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our iOS application GameLoggr (the "App") collects, uses, and protects your information.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Data Storage
- **Game Collection Data**: The App stores information about your video game collection locally on your device, including game titles, platforms, purchase information, play time, ratings, and personal notes.
- **Media Files**: You may choose to add custom cover art images and PDF manuals to your game entries, stored locally on your device.
- **Local Storage Only**: All your data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or third parties.

### Data We Do NOT Collect
- We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or contact information
- We do not track your location
- We do not collect device identifiers for advertising purposes
- We do not share your data with third parties for marketing purposes
- We do not have access to your data - it stays entirely on your device

## How We Use Your Information

### Primary Uses
- **App Functionality**: Your game collection data is used solely to provide the core features of the app
- **Local Processing**: All data processing happens entirely on your device
- **No Data Transmission**: Your personal data never leaves your device

### Third-Party Services

#### IGDB (Internet Game Database)
- **Optional Service**: You may choose to configure IGDB API credentials to search for game information
- **User-Provided Credentials**: You provide your own IGDB API credentials, which are stored securely in your device's Keychain
- **Public Data Only**: When you search IGDB, only public game information (titles, release dates, cover art, developer information) is retrieved
- **No Personal Data Shared**: Your personal game collection data is never sent to IGDB
- **Secure Storage**: Your API credentials are stored using iOS Keychain, the most secure storage available on iOS

#### External Links
- The app may contain links to external websites or services (such as game websites or music streaming services)
- No personal data is shared when opening these links
- We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party services

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Device Storage
- All your data is stored locally on your device using Apple's Core Data/SwiftData framework
- Data is protected by iOS security measures and your device's passcode/biometric authentication
- No sensitive data is stored in plain text
- Data is encrypted at rest using iOS built-in encryption

### API Credentials Security
- If you choose to configure IGDB API access, your credentials are stored in iOS Keychain
- Keychain is the most secure storage mechanism available on iOS
- Credentials are encrypted and can only be accessed by GameLoggr
- Credentials never leave your device

### No Cloud Storage
- GameLoggr does not use iCloud, our own servers, or any cloud storage services
- Your data exists only on your device
- We have no access to your data

## Your Rights and Choices

### Data Control
- **Complete Access**: You can view all your data within the app
- **Full Control**: You can edit or delete any data you've entered at any time
- **Data Portability**: You can export your data from the app
- **Complete Deletion**: You can delete the app and all associated data at any time
- **No Account Required**: The app works without creating any accounts

### API Credentials Management
- You have complete control over your IGDB API credentials
- You can view, modify, or delete stored credentials at any time through Settings
- Removing credentials only affects game search functionality - your collection data remains intact

## Children's Privacy

GameLoggr does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is designed for general audiences and does not contain features specifically directed at children. Since all data is stored locally on the device and we have no access to user data, we cannot inadvertently collect information from minors.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes through:
- App Store update descriptions
- In-app notifications (if applicable)
- Updated policy posted with new effective date

Continued use of the app after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.

## Data Retention

- Data is retained locally on your device as long as you use the app
- Deleting the app removes all local data permanently
- We have no servers or backups of your data
- You are responsible for backing up your data if desired (through the app's export feature)
